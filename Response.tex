% 致编辑与审稿人的总结信
%==========================================================

\textbf{Dear Editors and Reviewers:}

We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Editor-in-Chief, the Associate Editor, and the Reviewers for their time and effort in reviewing our manuscript. We are particularly grateful for the encouraging comments from \textbf{Reviewer \#2} and \textbf{Reviewer \#4}, who recognized the novelty and readiness of our work.

Simultaneously, we found the critical questions raised by \textbf{Reviewer \#1} and \textbf{Reviewer \#3} regarding physical layer assumptions and worst-case scenarios to be insightful. These comments have guided us to perform a fundamental upgrade to our simulation framework and validation methodology.

We have carefully addressed all comments point-by-point. Our major revisions are summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Re-executed ALL experiments using an upgraded high-fidelity simulation framework.
    \item Implemented a refined dynamic energy model for listening cost analysis.
    \item Introduced a Channel Middleware layer to model realistic physical layer imperfections.
    \item Conducted a comparative ablation study to verify our ``Earliest-Position-First'' strategy.
    \item Made the complete source code publicly available for transparency and reproducibility.
    \item Added a rigorous discussion on worst-case complexity; all major revisions are \added{highlighted in red} for easy tracking.
    \item Updated the references strictly according to IEEE journal requirements.
\end{enumerate}

We believe these extensive revisions have significantly strengthened the technical depth, rigor, and practical relevance of the paper. We hope the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication.

Best regards,

\textbf{Prof. Xiaolin Jia and Co-authors} \hfill \today

\begin{reviewercomment}
The paper assumes perfect physical layer conditions. How does the protocol perform under realistic channel impairments such as timing jitter, sensing errors, and tag dropout?
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{authorresponse}
Thank you for this insightful comment. We have introduced a Channel Middleware layer in our simulation framework to model realistic physical layer imperfections. Specifically, we now account for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Timing jitter ($\pm 5\%$ variation in slot boundaries)
    \item Bit-level sensing errors (BER = $10^{-3}$)
    \item Tag dropout probability ($p_{\text{drop}} = 0.01$)
\end{itemize}

The revised results show that LODS-MTI maintains its performance advantage with less than 3\% degradation. Please see Section 5.3:

\begin{revisedtext}
To validate the robustness of LODS-MTI under realistic conditions, we introduce a Channel Middleware layer that models three types of physical layer imperfections: (1) \added{timing jitter with $\pm 5\%$ slot boundary variation}, (2) \added{bit-level sensing errors at BER = $10^{-3}$}, and (3) \added{stochastic tag dropout with probability $p_{\text{drop}} = 0.01$}. Our experimental results demonstrate that the protocol maintains its performance advantage with less than 3\% degradation compared to ideal conditions.
\end{revisedtext}

% --- Comment 1.2 ---
\begin{reviewercomment}
The worst-case complexity analysis is missing. What happens when the number of missing tags is very large (e.g., 50\% or more)?
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{authorresponse}
We have added Section 4.4 analyzing the worst-case complexity:

\begin{revisedtext}
\textbf{Worst-Case Analysis.} When the missing rate $\alpha$ exceeds a threshold $\alpha_{\text{th}} = 0.5$, the communication overhead of incremental identification surpasses that of full re-inventory. In this regime, LODS-MTI \added{automatically triggers a fallback to complete re-inventory mode, which achieves $O(n)$ complexity where $n$ is the total tag population.}
\end{revisedtext}

Some references are not formatted according to IEEE standards. Please update accordingly.
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{authorresponse}
Thank you. We have reformatted all references to comply with IEEE transaction standards:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Replaced informal citations with proper IEEE format
    \item Added DOI links where available
    \item Ensured consistent author name formatting
\end{itemize}

% --- Comment 3.1 ---
\begin{reviewercomment}
The energy model does not account for the listening cost during idle slots. This may lead to underestimation of total energy consumption.
\end{reviewercomment}

\begin{authorresponse}
Excellent observation. We have refined the energy model to include listening costs. The updated analysis (Section 5.2):

\begin{revisedtext}
The total energy consumption $E_{\text{total}}$ is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{R} \left( E_{\text{tx},i} + \added{E_{\text{listen},i} \cdot N_{\text{active},i}} + E_{\text{idle},i} \right)
\end{equation}
where \added{$E_{\text{listen},i}$ represents the per-tag listening energy during round $i$, and $N_{\text{active},i}$ is the number of active tags in that round.}
\end{revisedtext}
